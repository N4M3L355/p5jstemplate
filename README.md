# p5jstemplate

Basic P5.js template to kickstart your idea. P5.js is used in instance mode(it's a bit faster that way and IDEs have better support for that). The p5.js library is linked locally in ```index.html```, but it is possible to change it by uncommenting the CDN links and commenting local links.
